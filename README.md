# Hi, fellow developers 👋

I'm **Amanda Albuquerque**, a Software Engineer and Engineering Manager based in **São Paulo, Brazil**.  
I build scalable web platforms, developer tooling, and backend services — with a strong focus on **product impact, engineering quality, and clear architecture**.

---

## 🚀 What I work on

My work usually lives at the intersection of **frontend platforms**, **backend services**, and **developer experience**.  
You’ll find here experiments, production-grade foundations, and open-source explorations across different stacks.

Some themes you’ll see repeatedly:

- Design systems & UI platforms
- API design (REST & GraphQL)
- Backend services in Go & Node.js
- LLM-powered content pipelines
- Infrastructure, CI/CD, and developer tooling
